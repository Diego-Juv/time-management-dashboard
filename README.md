## 📊 Introduction
This project presents a database tracking the time spent in work sessions. It compares the time invested in in-person sessions (such as work meetings, collaborative sessions in meeting rooms, etc.) versus online sessions (such as presentations of dashboards or meetings with remote colleagues).

The data was recorded in **Google Sheets** based on sessions scheduled in **Google Calendar**, and the dashboard was created using **Google Looker Studio**.
